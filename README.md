# Formal-System-Solver
This is a bot that beats all of the puzzles on a professor's website


One of my favorite topics in computer science is automation. I think it is really cool that a computer can
                omit any human need to perform an activity. A friend of mine, and also a professor at Temple University, Michael Wehar,
                has a game on his
                <a href="http://michaelwehar.com/metatree/replacement/" target="_blank">website</a>
                where you are given a starting string and must derive a new
                string by applying the correct sequence of rules. My project automates the whole activity.
                The bot logs you in, scrapes the starting string, ending string, and the three rules,
                determines the correct sequence of rules by inputting this information into an algorithm,
                and then submits the correct sequence of rules. Then it clicks next and solves the next puzzle. My bot solves
                all 1016 puzzles in about an hour. I really enjoyed this project because the puzzle exists in a formal system.
                The starting string and the three rules represent axioms in the system, and the ending string is a theorem that is
                derived by applying the correct sequence of rules. It relates to an interesting book called "Godel, Escher, Bach"
                from Douglas Hofstadter.
